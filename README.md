## Testing the site locally on your machine
The best way is to use the npm package browser-sync. When connected to the same wifi network,
any device can open and test the webpage, so you can easily test it on your phone and laptop/pc
simultaneously.
### To use browser-sync
make sure you have nodejs installed. Then installed the `browser-sync` package globally by using
the command
```
$ npm install -g browser-sync
```

### To test your site
`cd` into the directory and run the following command
```
$ browser-sync start --server --files "*/*"
```
You can then open the site on another device using the link given in the output of the above command.
It will be something like this: `External: http://192.168.0.103:3000`
